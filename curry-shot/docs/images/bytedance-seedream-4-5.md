## Basic model info

Model name: bytedance/seedream-4.5
Model description: Seedream 4.5: Upgraded Bytedance image model with stronger spatial understanding and world knowledge


## Model inputs

- prompt (required): Text prompt for image generation. Maximum 4000 characters. BytePlus recommends keeping prompts under 600 English words for best results. (string)
- image_input (optional): Input image(s) for image-to-image generation. List of 1-14 images for single or multi-reference generation. (array)
- size (optional): Image resolution: 2K (2048px), 4K (4096px), or 'custom' for specific dimensions. Note: 1K resolution is not supported in Seedream 4.5. (string)
- aspect_ratio (optional): Image aspect ratio. Only used when size is not 'custom'. Use 'match_input_image' to automatically match the input image's aspect ratio. (string)
- width (optional): Custom image width (only used when size='custom'). Range: 1024-4096 pixels. (integer)
- height (optional): Custom image height (only used when size='custom'). Range: 1024-4096 pixels. (integer)
- sequential_image_generation (optional): Group image generation mode. 'disabled' generates a single image. 'auto' lets the model decide whether to generate multiple related images (e.g., story scenes, character variations). (string)
- max_images (optional): Maximum number of images to generate when sequential_image_generation='auto'. Range: 1-15. Total images (input + generated) cannot exceed 15. (integer)
- disable_safety_checker (optional): Disable the safety checker for generated images. When enabled, input moderation is relaxed to only block illegal content (CSAM). Use responsibly. (boolean)
