## Basic model info

Model name: black-forest-labs/flux-2-flex
Model description: Max-quality image generation and editing with support for ten reference images


## Model inputs

- prompt (required): Text prompt for image generation (string)
- input_images (optional): List of input images for image-to-image generation. Maximum 10 images. Must be jpeg, png, gif, or webp. (array)
- aspect_ratio (optional): Aspect ratio for the generated image. Use 'match_input_image' to match the first input image's aspect ratio. (string)
- resolution (optional): Resolution in megapixels. Up to 4 MP is possible, but 2 MP or below is recommended. The maximum image size is 2048x2048, which means that high-resolution images may not respect the resolution if aspect ratio is not 1:1.

Resolution is not used when aspect_ratio is 'custom'. When aspect_ratio is 'match_input_image', use 'match_input_image' to match the input image's resolution (clamped to 0.5-4 MP). (string)
- width (optional): Width of the generated image. Only used when aspect_ratio=custom. Must be a multiple of 16 (if it's not, it will be rounded to nearest multiple of 16). (integer)
- height (optional): Height of the generated image. Only used when aspect_ratio=custom. Must be a multiple of 16 (if it's not, it will be rounded to nearest multiple of 16). (integer)
- safety_tolerance (optional): Safety tolerance, 1 is most strict and 5 is most permissive (integer)
- seed (optional): Random seed. Set for reproducible generation (integer)
- prompt_upsampling (optional): Automatically modify the prompt for more creative generation (boolean)
- steps (optional): Number of inference steps (integer)
- guidance (optional): Guidance scale for generation. Controls how closely the output follows the prompt (number)
- output_format (optional): Format of the output images. (string)
- output_quality (optional): Quality when saving the output images, from 0 to 100. 100 is best quality, 0 is lowest quality. Not relevant for .png outputs (integer)

## Model readme

> # Flux 2 Flex
>
> Flux 2 Flex from Black Forest Labs gives you control over the quality-speed trade-off when generating images. Unlike typical text-to-image models that make these decisions for you, Flex lets you adjust how many steps to run and how strongly the model should follow your prompt.
>
> This is the model to reach for when you're iterating on designs, creating typography-heavy work like infographics or UI mockups, or editing images with multiple reference photos.
>
> ## What it's good at
>
> Text rendering is where Flex really shines. The model can reliably generate clean typography, readable captions, and complex layouts—the kind of stuff that usually takes multiple attempts with other models. If you're making memes, posters, or product mockups with text, this is your model.
>
> The multi-reference feature lets you blend up to ten images into a single output while keeping things coherent. Use this for style transfer, compositional guidance, or when you want to combine elements from different sources.
>
> ## Practical tips
>
> **Start simple with plain text prompts.** You don't need to overthink it:
>
> ```
> A neon-lit cyberpunk alley at night, rain-slick streets, reflective puddles
> ```
>
> **For more control, use a structured approach.** Describe what you want in clear sections:
>
> ```
> Scene: Modern coffee shop interior with large windows
> Subjects: Barista preparing espresso, two customers chatting at a table
> Lighting: Warm afternoon sunlight streaming through windows
> Style: Photorealistic with shallow depth of field
> Camera: Shot at eye level with 35mm lens
> ```
>
> **Negative prompts don't work here.** Instead of saying what you don't want, be specific about what you do want. Say "clean background" instead of "no clutter."
>
> ## How the parameters work
>
> **Guidance scale** controls how closely the model sticks to your prompt. Lower values (around 2-3) give the model more creative freedom. Higher values (4-5) make it follow your instructions more literally. Start around 3.5 and adjust based on what you're seeing.
>
> **Number of steps** is your quality dial. Fewer steps (6-10) generate images quickly but with less detail—good for rapid prototyping. More steps (20-50) take longer but produce sharper results with better typography. For most work, 20 steps hits a good balance.
>
> **Multi-reference images** let you upload up to ten reference photos (14 MB total). The model will extract style, composition, and other visual elements to inform the generation. This is useful for maintaining consistent characters across outputs or matching a specific aesthetic.
>
> ## Image editing
>
> Flex handles editing at resolutions up to 4 megapixels. Upload a base image and describe what you want to change or add. The model will make modifications while keeping the rest of the image coherent.
>
> For style transfer or compositional changes, provide reference images alongside your edit instructions. The model uses these to understand the direction you're going.
>
> ## What to expect
>
> Output resolution is 1024 × 1024 pixels in PNG format. The model accepts PNG or JPEG inputs for reference images and editing tasks.
>
> Generation time varies based on your step count—expect 10-30 seconds for typical runs. Higher resolutions and more steps will take longer.
>
> This model is built for production workflows where you need reliable typography and the flexibility to fine-tune quality versus speed. If you're making quick sketches or need the absolute highest fidelity, check out the other models in the [Flux family](https://replicate.com/collections/flux).
>
> ## Try it yourself
>
> You can experiment with Flux 2 Flex on the Replicate Playground at [replicate.com/playground](https://replicate.com/playground).
